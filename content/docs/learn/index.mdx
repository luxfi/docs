## Why Lux?

### Post-Quantum Ready
Lux Network is built from the ground up with post-quantum cryptographic primitives, ensuring security against both classical and quantum computing attacks.

### Multi-Consensus
Unlike single-consensus blockchains, Lux supports multiple consensus mechanisms optimized for different use cases - from fast finality to maximum decentralization.

### EVM Compatible
Full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility means existing Solidity smart contracts can be deployed on Lux with minimal modifications.

### High Performance
Designed for enterprise-grade throughput with sub-second finality and horizontal scalability.
