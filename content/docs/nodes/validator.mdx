# Running a Validator

Validators secure the Lux Network by participating in consensus. In return, they earn staking rewards proportional to their stake and uptime. This guide covers setup, staking, delegation, and rewards.

## Requirements

### Staking Requirements

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Minimum stake** | 2,000 LUX |
| **Maximum stake** | 3,000,000 LUX |
| **Minimum delegation** | 25 LUX |
| **Minimum delegation fee** | 2% |
| **Minimum staking period** | 2 weeks |
| **Maximum staking period** | 1 year |
| **Uptime requirement** | 80% |

### Hardware Requirements

Validators need reliable hardware with high uptime. Use the same requirements as a [full node](/docs/nodes/full-node), with emphasis on:

- **Stable network connection**: 1 Gbps recommended with low latency
- **UPS or redundant power**: Downtime reduces rewards
- **NVMe storage**: Consistent I/O performance during consensus
- **Dedicated machine**: Avoid sharing resources with other workloads

<Callout>
  A validator that falls below 80% uptime during its staking period receives zero rewards for that period. There is no partial reward -- it is all or nothing.
</Callout>

## Validator Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run a Full Node First

    Your node must be fully bootstrapped before you can register as a validator. Follow the [full node guide](/docs/nodes/full-node) and wait until `info.isBootstrapped` returns `true` for all chains.

    ```bash
    luxd --network-id=mainnet
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Get Your Node ID

    ```bash
    curl -s -X POST --data '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "info.getNodeID"
    }' -H 'content-type:application/json' http://localhost:9650/ext/info
    ```

    Response:

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "result": {
        "nodeID": "NodeID-..."
      },
      "id": 1
    }
    ```

    Save this Node ID -- you will need it for the staking transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Fund Your P-Chain Address

    You need at least 2,000 LUX on the P-Chain. If your LUX is on the C-Chain, transfer it:

    ```bash
    # Export from C-Chain
    lux transfer export --source c-chain --destination p-chain --amount 2000 --network mainnet

    # Import on P-Chain
    lux transfer import --chain p-chain --network mainnet
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Register as a Validator

    ```bash
    lux validator add \
      --node-id=NodeID-... \
      --stake-amount=2000 \
      --start-time="$(date -u -d '+10 minutes' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
      --end-time="$(date -u -d '+365 days' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
      --delegation-fee=2 \
      --network=mainnet
    ```

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `--node-id` | Your node's ID from step 2 |
    | `--stake-amount` | Amount of LUX to stake (minimum 2,000) |
    | `--start-time` | When validation begins (must be in the future) |
    | `--end-time` | When validation ends (max 1 year from start) |
    | `--delegation-fee` | Percentage fee charged to delegators (minimum 2%) |
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify Registration

    ```bash
    curl -s -X POST --data '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 1,
      "method": "platform.getCurrentValidators",
      "params": {}
    }' -H 'content-type:application/json' http://localhost:9650/ext/P
    ```

    Your Node ID should appear in the response once the start time has passed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Management

Validator keys are critical. The staking key (`staker.key`) and certificate (`staker.crt`) are stored in the node's staking directory.

```
~/.luxd/staking/
  staker.key    # Private key for P2P identity
  staker.crt    # TLS certificate
```

<Callout>
  Back up your staking key and certificate securely. If these files are lost, you lose your Node ID and cannot recover your validator identity. Store copies in encrypted offline storage.
</Callout>

### Key Security Best Practices

- **Never share** `staker.key` with anyone
- **Encrypt backups** using GPG or age
- **Use a hardware security module (HSM)** for high-value validators
- **Rotate keys** when decommissioning hardware

## Delegation

Other LUX holders can delegate their stake to your validator to increase its weight (and your rewards).

### How Delegation Works

1. A delegator selects your validator and locks their LUX
2. Your validator's total stake increases by the delegated amount
3. You earn a delegation fee (minimum 2%) from the delegator's rewards
4. The delegator earns staking rewards minus your fee

### Delegation Limits

The maximum stake a validator can have (own stake + delegations) is the minimum of:
- 5x the validator's own stake
- 3,000,000 LUX

For example, a validator with 2,000 LUX can accept up to 8,000 LUX in delegations (for a total of 10,000 LUX).

## Rewards Calculation

Rewards are distributed at the end of each staking period based on:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Stake amount** | Higher stake = more rewards |
| **Staking duration** | Longer periods earn a higher rate |
| **Remaining supply** | Rewards decrease as total supply approaches the 2 TLUX cap |
| **Uptime** | Must be at least 80% to receive any rewards |

### Reward Formula

```
MintingRate = MinRate + (MaxRate - MinRate) * (Duration / MaxDuration)
Reward = RemainingSupply * (Stake / TotalStaked) * MintingRate * (Duration / Year)
```

| Parameter | Mainnet Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| MinConsumptionRate | 10% annually |
| MaxConsumptionRate | 12% annually |
| MintingPeriod | 365 days |
| SupplyCap | 2,000,000,000,000 LUX |

### Example

For a validator staking 10,000 LUX for 1 year with the network at 50% of supply cap:

```
MintingRate = 0.10 + (0.12 - 0.10) * (365/365) = 0.12 (12%)
Reward = RemainingSupply * (10000 / TotalStaked) * 0.12 * 1
```

## Uptime and Slashing

### Uptime Tracking

Lux tracks validator uptime through peer observations. Other validators report whether they can reach your node.

- Uptime is calculated as: `time_connected / total_staking_period`
- The uptime threshold for receiving rewards is **80%**

### Slashing

Lux does **not** implement traditional slashing (stake destruction) for downtime. Instead:

- Validators below 80% uptime receive **zero rewards** for that period
- The staked LUX is returned in full at the end of the staking period
- There is no risk of losing your staked principal

This design encourages uptime without the catastrophic risk of stake loss from transient issues.

## Monitoring Your Validator

### Check Uptime

```bash
curl -s -X POST --data '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "platform.getCurrentValidators",
  "params": {
    "nodeIDs": ["NodeID-..."]
  }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json' http://localhost:9650/ext/P
```

The response includes `uptime` as a decimal (e.g., `0.95` = 95%).

### Alerts to Configure

| Alert | Trigger | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Node offline | No peers for > 5 min | Critical |
| Low uptime | Below 85% | Warning |
| Disk space | Below 20% free | Warning |
| Version outdated | New release available | Info |
