  "description": "Luxd can be configured to run with an indexer. That is, it saves (indexes) every container (a block, vertex or transaction) it accepts on the X-Chain, P-Chain and C-Chain. To run Luxd with indexing enabled, set command line flag --index-enabled to true. Luxd will only index containers that are accepted when running with --index-enabled set to true. To ensure your node has a complete index, run a node with a fresh database and --index-enabled set to true. The node will accept every block, vertex and transaction in the network history during bootstrapping, ensuring your index is complete. It is OK to turn off your node if it is running with indexing enabled. If it restarts with indexing still enabled, it will accept all containers that were accepted while it was offline. The indexer should never fail to index an accepted block, vertex or transaction.",
