# Code Contributions Best Practices

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before contributing code to LUX-related GitHub repositories, please read this quick guide on best practices.

## **Monthly Weight Bidding Schedule**
To streamline the process of offering and accepting code contributions, please follow the following schedule:

### TLDR: Propose work at the beginning of the month, if accepted, do the work, submit completed code at the end of the month, get the code judged, and rewarded. 

- By the 7th - Maintainers judge contributions from the previous month.
- By the ~8th - LUX smart contract updated with new weights.
- By the 9th - Contributors submit new bids by filling out this form: [Bid for Weights Form](https://forms.gle/ZBmPXq4jZ3L6qwqR8) (R&D version, pre LUX.Software).
- By the 15th - Maintainers will accept or reject new bids.
- By the 31st - Contributors submit Form Y describing a delivered contribution by filling out this form: [Delivered Contribution Form](https://forms.gle/51Bsd4QWoURAXEc7A) and add the normal information on GitHub to the snapshot file for that month.

*Note: The smart contract gets updated on or around the 8th to the 9th of the month reflecting the previous month's deliverables.

### 1. The Key Is To Add Value To Get Merged / Rewarded
Weights are NOT based on the Labor Theory of Value. It doesn't matter how many hours are worked but rather the value produced by the work. That's why the repository owner has to actually merge in the code (the product of the work) for it to count toward rewards. The repository owner acts as the "customer" in the marketplace. Look at other contributors to the repo and gauge the needs of the repository owner or read the current proposals in the MRC repository to see what future coding work is being proposed: [MRC Repository](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC)

Please read the [Code Contributor Weights Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md) to understand the implied value per weight which is updated each month.

### 2. Be Reasonable and Competitive 
If the code contributor is asking too many weights for the contribution, or the quality of the contribution cannot be assessed or is of low quality, it is likely to be rejected by the repository owner.

### 3. Combine Your Code Contribution With Request For Weights In One PR
When you do submit a pull request, consider combining the contribution itself with the request for weights in one pull request, so it can be accepted or rejected by the repo owner without having to look through multiple pull requests.

### 4. Message The Repository Owner First
If you are considering working on something substantial that will take a lot of development weights, you should consider contacting the repo owner and inquire about their interest in the function, feature, or application you are considering developing first before spending time on it.

### 5. Offer To Open Source Upon Acceptance 
If you are concerned about contributing something closed source and it being picked up by someone else, consider starting with a more restrictive license and offer to flip it to the MIT open source standard if the contribution is accepted by the repository owner. 

### 6. Avoid Overlapping Commits on the Last Line of The Code - Proof_Of_Contribution.md File
When requesting weights, contributors often add their entry to the last line of the [Code Contributions](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/tree/main/Contributions) table. This can cause conflicts when merging pull requests as multiple requests may modify the same line. 

Consider placing your commit on a line other than the last one. As code proof moves to a monthly basis, consider adding your code to a line equal to the date of its commitment. Please use the latest snapshot table to add your contribution.

### 7. Timeline for Submission and Acceptance / Rejection of Code Contribution
If an idea for a future contribution is being requested, then the requester should include a timeline in the request.
So for example, if the GitHub repo owner wants contributors to create an Italian version of the white paper, then they should set a timeline, say 7 days, for submissions. Then contributors should expect that the GitHub repo owner will accept the best work done at the lowest number of weights requested. 

This creates a free market for code and lets people freely compete, and the GitHub repo owner gets the benefit of comparing submissions at the same time instead of just accepting whichever contributor finished first. This ought to result in better outcomes and clear expectations from both sides.

### 8. Review Process to Rate Quality
A second contributor can review other works submitted for quality and submit the review for 20% of the weights related to the submission.

### 9. Support / Updates To Code
If you contribute documentation, such as a translation of a white paper, there is an expectation that when updates are made to the original document you will, in turn, update the derivative document. If derivative contributions are not kept up, they can be replaced by a different contributor and the weights credited will be redirected to the new contributor.

### 10. Code & Rewards Are Dynamic
The LUX codebase is ever-evolving. Weights credited only last as long as the codebase utilizes the code provided.
