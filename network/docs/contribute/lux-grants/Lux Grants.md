## Mission and Scope

As the public-facing allocation arm of Lux Partners Limited, the Lux Grant Program provides funding and support to projects that strengthen Lux's foundations and enable future builders. We focus on work that promotes:

- **Quantum-Safe Technologies**: Advancing encryption protocols to secure digital assets and transactions against quantum computing threats.

We don't often fund end-user applications or commercial projects unless they serve as research or educational tools or as reference implementations of new standards.

## How We Support

Grants are direct funding awarded following a formal application, evaluation, and input from technical advisors. Grants are not donations or equity investments. We provide grants to support recipients in building things that are vital to Lux's success, without the need to commercialize their work, ensuring these resources remain free and open to all.

The Lux Grant Program is separated into two categories, **Small Grants** and **Project Grants**, each with a different process and criteria. We also provide non-financial support, such as visibility, access to our knowledge base, connections to leading developers and researchers, and guidance from our dedicated team.

## Project Grants

### Summary

Project grants undergo an intensive process of review and potential rescoping. There is no hard limit on the size of the request, and the timeline for a decision is typically two months but varies depending on factors such as the technical nature of the work, amount of due diligence required, and how much revision is required from the original proposal.

A Project Grant might be a good fit if any of the following apply to your project:

- **More complex or larger in scope**: The proposed work has multiple components or stages, a longer project timeline, or will require you to make new long-term hires.
- **Higher cost**: Your expected budget exceeds $30,000.
- **A mature idea**: You have thought deeply about your goals and strategy, validated your approach, and thoroughly researched the state of the art in your chosen domain.

*If you're feeling uncertain about anything in the application, please consider signing up for Office Hours before submitting.*

#### 2. Evaluate and Refine

If we determine that a project is in scope for the Lux Grant Program, we'll begin a deeper evaluation of the project's technical approach, potential impact, risks, and other factors. Our next steps might include gathering more information, getting input from advisors, and working with you to refine or rescope the project proposal.

#### 3. Decision

Once the proposal is finalized, we'll make an allocation decision based on our assessment as well as input received from advisors. Decision time for a project grant application varies depending on scope and complexity and may take a few months from when the application was first submitted.

#### 4. Activation

We sign a grant agreement, complete KYC (Know Your Customer), and send funds in fiat or cryptocurrency (e.g., LUX Coin, Bitcoin). You'll have a point of contact at Lux who will check in with you regularly as you progress with your work.

### Tips for Submitting a Great Application

The information you submit is what we'll use to make a decision about whether to proceed with your grant application, so take the time to understand what we're looking for and answer the form questions thoughtfully. When evaluating your application, we look for much more than just an explanation of the proposed work. In order to determine the potential impact on the ecosystem, we need a deeper understanding of both the “why” and the “how” of the project. Some things to keep in mind:

- **Be Specific**: Share your grand vision, but also tell us concretely how you plan to achieve your goals.
- **Be Thorough**: Provide as much information as possible. Include supporting documents like whitepapers, research papers, or presentations.
- **Show Your Work**: Demonstrate that you've validated and refined your approach and researched other solutions, and articulate how yours is different.
- **Dig Deeper**: Explain why solving the specific problem is important, how it will benefit the Lux ecosystem, and how it fits within our mission.
- **Think Broader**: Consider how your project connects to, complements, and enables the work of others, and how it can have a sustained impact.
- **Identify Output and Outcome**: Specify the tangible results of your work and how they will be accessed or used by others.
- **Be Realistic**: Request a funding amount that reflects what you'll need for the specific work in your proposal.
- **Be Flexible**: Be open to revising your proposal. We may suggest breaking the project into components or phases to maximize impact.
