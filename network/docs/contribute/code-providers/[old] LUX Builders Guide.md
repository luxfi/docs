## Intro & Purpose:
Lux is open-source. Part of the Lux Treasury goes towards rewarding users who contribute work for Lux. This can be adding
to the open-source code itself, improving on it; providing translations and features for the Lux website and dApps; as well
as fulfilling other Requests for Contribution.

## Other Ways to Contribute To LUX
If you have improvements you want to propose to the LUX Reference Implementations, the LUX Request for Comments (MRC) repository is here:
