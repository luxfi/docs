# Code Contributor Guide to Earning Weights & Their Implied Value for Lux

**TL;DR**

Code contributors to the Lux project earn rewards based on a "weights" system. Your allocation of LUX tokens is calculated by dividing your individual weights by the total weights for that month and then multiplying by the LUX tokens allocated for that month. This system incentivizes early and sustained contributions, with higher rewards given earlier in the program.

---

## Introduction

The weights system is designed to:

- **Maximize Value for Lux**: Allocate weights to contributors in a way that benefits the overall project.
- **Fairly Reward Contributors**: Provide greater rewards to those who contribute early when the project risk is higher.
- **Encourage Long-Term Participation**: Incentivize contributors to remain engaged over the full duration of the program.
- **Simplify the Process**: Make the allocation and reward system transparent and easy to understand.

## Total Allocation and Duration

- **Total LUX Allocation for Code Contributions**: **100,000,000,000 LUX**
- **Program Duration**: **2 years** (24 months)
- **Total Weights to be Allocated**: **100,000,000 weights**

## Weights Emission Schedule

Weights are allocated monthly over the 24-month period, decreasing by **10% each month** to incentivize early contributions.

## How Rewards Are Calculated

At the end of each month:

1. **Snapshot of Weights**: A snapshot is taken of all contributors' weights.
2. **Calculate Individual Share**: Your share is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Your LUX Reward} = \left( \frac{\text{Your Weights}}{\text{Total Weights for the Month}} \right) \times \text{LUX Tokens Allocated for the Month}
   \]

3. **Distribution**: LUX tokens are distributed based on the above calculation.

---

## Example Calculation

- **Month**: 1
- **Total Weights Emitted**: 10,863,066
- **LUX Tokens Allocated**: 10,863,066,493 LUX
- **Your Contribution**: 50,000 weights
- **Your Share**:

  \[
  \text{Your LUX Reward} = \left( \frac{50,000}{10,863,066} \right) \times 10,863,066,493 = 50,000 \times 1,000 = 50,000,000 LUX
  \]

---

## Incentives for Early Contribution

- **Higher Weights**: More weights are allocated in the earlier months.
- **More LUX Tokens**: Higher LUX token allocations in the early months mean greater rewards.
- **Long-Term Benefits**: Early contributors accumulate more weights, increasing their share in subsequent distributions.

---

## Monthly Snapshot Schedule

- **Snapshot Date**: The 1st of every month at 00:00 UTC.
- **Eligibility**: Contributions must be merged into the main codebase before the snapshot date to be counted.
- **Transparency**: All snapshots and distributions will be publicly recorded.

---

## Maintaining and Earning Weights

- **Active Contributions**: Regularly contribute code, bug fixes, and enhancements.
- **Quality Over Quantity**: High-quality contributions may be awarded additional weights.
- **Continued Engagement**: Stay active throughout the program to maximize your total weights.

---

## Conclusion

This weights and rewards system is designed to fairly compensate contributors based on their efforts and the value they bring to the Lux project. By participating early and consistently, you can maximize your rewards and play a significant role in the development of Lux.

**Note**: This model is subject to adjustments based on community feedback and project needs. Any changes will be communicated in advance.
