# Lux Request for Comment (LRC): Community Contribution Framework for the Lux Ecosystem

**LRC Number**: 001  
**Title**: Community Contribution Framework for Auditing, Improvements, and Upgrades  
**Status**: Draft  
**Type**: Standards Track  
**Created**: 2024-11-20

## Abstract

This LRC proposes a framework to encourage and streamline community contributions to the Lux ecosystem. The goal is to enhance the development of Lux's products and services through community auditing, improvements, help in developing unfinished components, and upgrades to existing platforms. This framework outlines guidelines for contribution, areas of focus, and processes to ensure efficient collaboration between the Lux team and the community.

## Motivation

The Lux ecosystem comprises a comprehensive suite of products and services, some of which are live and others in development. To accelerate growth and innovation, we aim to leverage the power of open-source collaboration. By welcoming community contributions, we can:

- Identify and resolve "unknown unknowns" through diverse perspectives.
- Accelerate the development of unfinished components.
- Enhance existing platforms with new features and improvements.
- Foster a vibrant community around Lux, promoting adoption and innovation.

## Specification

### Scope of Contributions

Community members can contribute to the following areas:

1. **Auditing and Security**: Perform code audits to identify vulnerabilities, bugs, or performance issues.
2. **Development of Unfinished Components**: Assist in developing projects that are not yet live, such as Lux ZChain and Lux Vote.
3. **Upgrades and Enhancements**: Propose and implement new features or improvements to existing platforms like Lux Wallet and Lux Bridge.
4. **Cross-Chain Integrations**: Add support for other blockchains (e.g., Solana, Cardano) to enhance interoperability.
5. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Improve existing documentation and create tutorials to aid new users and developers.

### Contribution Guidelines

- **Repository Structure**: All projects will have a standardized repository structure to make navigation and contribution easier.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, suggest enhancements, or propose new features.
- **Pull Requests**: Contributors should fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request (PR) for review.
- **Coding Standards**: Follow the Lux coding standards provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of each repository.
- **Code Reviews**: PRs will be reviewed by maintainers and the community. Feedback should be constructive and respectful.
- **Testing**: Ensure that all new code includes appropriate tests and passes existing test suites.
- **Licensing**: Contributions must comply with the project's open-source license (BSD License).

### Recognition and Rewards

To incentivize contributions:

- **Weights System**: Implement the previously defined weights system to reward contributors with LUX tokens based on their contributions.
- **Contributor Recognition**: Acknowledge significant contributors in release notes, documentation, and the Lux community platforms.
- **Bounties**: Set up a bounty program for high-priority issues or features, offering LUX tokens as rewards.

### Communication Channels

- **Discord**: A dedicated Discord server for real-time communication between contributors and maintainers.
- **Forums**: A community forum for in-depth discussions, proposals, and collaboration.
- **Regular Meetings**: Schedule regular virtual meetings or AMA sessions to discuss progress and address concerns.

### Security and Compliance

- **Security Audits**: Contributions involving critical code paths will undergo rigorous security audits.
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensure that all contributions comply with relevant laws and regulations, especially for financial and security-related projects.

## Rationale

By establishing a clear and structured framework, we can lower the barrier to entry for community members to contribute effectively. This approach ensures that contributions are meaningful, aligned with Lux's goals, and that contributors feel valued and rewarded.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LRC does not introduce any backward compatibility issues as it adds a new process for community contributions without altering existing functionalities.

## Test Cases

As this LRC outlines a framework rather than code changes, test cases are not applicable. However, the success of this framework can be evaluated based on metrics such as:

- Number of community contributions.
- Reduction in bugs and vulnerabilities.
- Development speed of unfinished components.
- Community engagement levels.

## Implementation

The implementation details are provided in the accompanying Lux Reference Implementation (LRI-001).

## Security Considerations

- **Code Quality**: Require thorough code reviews and testing to maintain high code quality.
- **Access Control**: Limit write access to main branches to authorized maintainers.
- **Disclosure Policies**: Establish responsible disclosure policies for security vulnerabilities.
