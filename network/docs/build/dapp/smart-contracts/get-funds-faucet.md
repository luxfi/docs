# Get Test Funds from the Testnet Faucet

The [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.lux.network) sends LUX to X-Chain or C-Chain
addresses to help you test. (This testnet LUX has no value.)

We can get a "drip" of LUX from the Testnet faucet. Paste the address into the
[Testnet faucet website](https://faucet.lux.network). These LUX are for the Testnet
Testnet and have no monetary value.

The faucet will send some LUX to the address and return a transaction ID
(txID). This txID can be used with the Testnet Explorer to learn more about
the transaction.
