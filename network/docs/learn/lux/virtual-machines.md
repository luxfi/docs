# Virtual Machines

In a nutshell, a **Virtual Machine** (VM) is the blueprint for a blockchain, meaning it defines
the application-level logic of a blockchain. In technical terms, it specifies the blockchainâ€™s state,
state transition function, transactions, and the API through which users can interact with the
blockchain. 

You can use the same VM to create many blockchains, each of which follows the same rule-set but is
independent of all others.

## Why Run a VM on Lux?

_Developers with advanced use-cases for utilizing distributed ledger technology are often forced to build
their own blockchain from scratch, re-implement complex abstractions like networking and consensus,
all before even being able to start working on their new application._

**With Lux,**

- Developers can create a VM that defines how their blockchain 
should behave, and use this blueprint to coordinate validators in the network to run 
the application. 

- VMs can be written in any language, and use libraries and tech stacks that its creator
is familiar with. Developers have fine control over the behavior of their blockchain, and can redefine
the rules of a blockchain to fit any use-case they have.

- Developers don't need to concern themselves with lower-level logic
like networking, consensus, and the structure of the blockchain. Lux does
this behind the scenes so you can focus on building your Dapp, your ecosystem, and your community.


## How VMs Work

VMs communicate with Lux over a language agnostic request-response protocol known as
[RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call). This allows the VM framework to 
open a world of endless possibilities, as developers can implement their Dapps using 
the languages, frameworks, and libraries of their choice. To get started, create a VM out-of-the-box
with the [Subnet-EVM](/build/subnet/c-chain-vs-subnet.md) in Solidity, or design a custom VM with languages
like Golang, Rust, and many more.

## Running a VM

All Lux validators as members of the Lux Primary Network are required to run three VMs:

- Coreth: Defines the Contract Chain (C-Chain); supports smart contract functionality and is
EVM-compatible.
- Platform VM: Defines the Platform Chain (P-Chain); supports operations on staking and Subnets.
- Lux VM: Defines the Exchange Chain (X-Chain); supports operations on Lux Native
  Tokens.

All three can easily be run on any computer with [Luxd](/nodes).

Validators can install additional VMs on their node to validate additional
[Subnets](subnets-overview.md) in the Lux ecosystem. In exchange, validators receive
staking rewards in the form of a reward token determined by the Subnets.

### Solidity

Lux natively supports the execution of Ethereum smart contracts written in solidity. Ethereum
developers have the option of deploying their smart contracts on the C-Chain's implementation of the
Ethereum Virtual Machine ([Coreth](https://github.com/luxfi/coreth)),
or on their own Subnet using the
[Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm) for advanced use cases that require more customization.

Both C-Chain and the Subnet-EVM are compatible with Ethereum tooling like Remix, Core, MetaMask,
thirdweb, and more.

  - An implementation of the EVM that powers the Lux C-Chain that supports Solidity smart
  contracts.
- [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm)
  - An implementation of the EVM that can be deployed to a custom Subnet to support Solidity smart
  contracts
- [TimestampVM](https://github.com/luxfi/timestampvm)
  - A decentralized timestamp server
- [XSVM](https://github.com/luxfi/xsvm)
  - An example of Lux Network Messaging that implements Cross-Subnet asset transfers

### Rust

The following VMs were built using Rust via the [Lux Rust SDK](https://crates.io/crates/types)

- [TimestampVM RS](https://github.com/luxfi/timestampvm-rs)
  - A Rust implementation of TimestampVM
