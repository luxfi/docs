# Lux Mainnet

The Lux Mainnet refers to the main network of the Lux blockchain where real transactions
and smart contract executions occur. It is the final and production-ready version of the
blockchain where users can interact with the network and transact with real world assets.

A _network of networks_, Lux Mainnet includes the
[Primary Network](/learn/lux/lux-platform.md)
formed by the X, P, and C-Chain, as well as all in-production
[Subnets](/learn/lux/subnets-overview.md). These Subnets are independent blockchain sub-networks
that can be tailored to specific application use cases, use their own consensus mechanisms, define
their own token economics, and be run by different [virtual machines](/learn/lux/virtual-machines.md).

## Adding Lux Mainnet to EVM-Compatible Wallets

Most users will want to add the Lux Mainnet to their EVM-compatible wallet, such as Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, or Phantom. Use the following settings to configure the network in your wallet:
