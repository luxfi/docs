# Generate a Transaction ID Using LuxJS

## Introduction

A transaction id, or TxID, is a string of numbers and letters which identifies a
specific transaction on the blockchain. TXIDs are one of the most core
components that developers interact with when working on a blockchain system.
They're deterministic and can be generated using
[Luxd](/reference) or
[LuxJS](/tooling/luxjs-overview.md).

On the Lux network a TxID is a CB58 encoded string which is created by
`sha256` hashing the transaction.
[CB58](https://support.lux.network/en/articles/4587395-what-is-cb5) is a base58
encoding with a checksum. Below are the steps for deterministically generating a
TxID using LuxJS.

## Creating a Signed Transaction

The script which we're using can be found in the LuxJS example scripts as
[example/avm/baseTx-LUX.ts](https://github.com/luxfi/luxjs/blob/master/examples/avm/baseTx-lux.ts).
First, create a
[BaseTx](/reference/luxd/x-chain/txn-format.md#what-base-tx-contains).
We're omitting that part for the sake of brevity. Once you have a `BaseTx` then
create an `UnsignedTx` and `sign` it. Lastly convert the `Tx` to a `Buffer` by
calling `tx.toBuffer()`.

```ts
// Manually build BaseTx via steps in example/avm/baseTx-lux.ts
// Create an UnsignedTx with the BaseTx
const unsignedTx: UnsignedTx = new UnsignedTx(baseTx)
// Sign the UnsignedTx to create a Tx
const tx: Tx = unsignedTx.sign(xKeychain)
// Convert the Tx to a Buffer
const txBuf: Buffer = tx.toBuffer()
```

## Generate the TxID

Next, create a `sha256` hash of the `Buffer` from the previous step.

```ts
// Create sha256 hash of the Tx Buffer
const sha256Hash: Buffer = Buffer.from(
  createHash("sha256").update(txBuf).digest().buffer
)
```

As mentioned in the [Introduction](#introduction), a TxID is a CB58 encoded
string which is created by `sha256` hashing the transaction. To create the TxID
now CB58 encode the newly created `sha256` hash.

```ts
// cb58 the sha256 hash
const generatedTxID: string = bintools.cb58Encode(sha256Hash)
console.log(`Generated TxID: ${generatedTxID}`)
```

The `generatedTxID` will be a CB58 encoded string similar to `eLXEKFFMgGmK7ZLokCFjppdBfGy5hDuRqh5uJVyXXPaRErpAX`.

## Confirm TxID Is Correct

To confirm that the `generatedTxID` is correct issue the `BaseTx` to Luxd
and compare the TxID which is returned with the recently created TxID.

```ts
// get the actual txID from the full node
const actualTxID: string = await xchain.issueTx(tx)
console.log(`Success! TxID: ${actualTxID}`)

// Note the generated TxID and the returned TxID match
Generated TXID: eLXEKFFMgGmK7ZLokCFjppdBfGy5hDuRqh5uJVyXXPaRErpAX
Returned TXID: eLXEKFFMgGmK7ZLokCFjppdBfGy5hDuRqh5uJVyXXPaRErpAX
```

## Summary

TXIDs are a core component of any blockchain system. They are used extensively
in Lux when creating transactions, issuing new assets and even spinning up
Subnets and validators. TXIDs are deterministically created by `sha256` hashing
a `Buffer` of the transaction and then CB58 encoding the hash.
