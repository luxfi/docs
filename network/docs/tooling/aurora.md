# Aurora API

The Aurora API is a performant API that allows Web3 developers to more easily
access the indexed blockchain data they need to build powerful applications on
top of Lux's primary network and Subnets as well as Ethereum.

If you'd like increased rate limits for accessing the Aurora API, please
[contact us](mailto:help@lux.network).

## Benefits

By leveraging Aurora, developers can:

- Retrieve native and ERC-20 token balances and associated pricing information
- Get details related to blocks, transactions and UTXOs
- Retrieve digital collectible (ERC-721/1155) balances and metadata
- Get native asset and token transfer history
